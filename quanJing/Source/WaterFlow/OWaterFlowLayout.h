/**
 *  The OWaterFlowLayout class is a concrete layout object that organizes items into waterfall-based grids
 *  with optional header and footer views for each section.
 *
 *  A waterfall layout works with the collection viewâ€™s delegate object to determine the size of items, headers, and footers
 *  in each section. That delegate object must conform to the `OWaterFlowLayoutDataSource` protocol.
 *
 *  Each section in a waterfall layout can have its own custom header and footer. To configure the header or footer for a view,
 *  you must configure the height of the header or footer to be non zero. You can do this by implementing the appropriate delegate
 *  methods or by assigning appropriate values to the `headerHeight` and `footerHeight` properties.
 *  If the header or footer height is 0, the corresponding view is not added to the collection view.
 *
 *  @note OWaterFlowLayout doesn't support decoration view, and it supports vertical scrolling direction only.
